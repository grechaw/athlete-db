Now that instance data is all loaded, we can experiment with other
Entity Services code-generated artifacts.

`./gradlew mlReloadModules mlReloadSchemas`

`./gradlew mlDeploy`

Now you can step through the QConsole workspace to sample how
Entity Services made:

database configuration.
Search API options.
Extraction Template.
Triples.
